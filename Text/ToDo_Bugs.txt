Due to moving onto the tagging based program, this is likely a final list of possible features and known bugs. The unlikely features are very unlikely to be implemented.

======================
Possible (Unlikely) Features
======================

- Overhaul of the tag system. Try to integrate with meta-data (in the image files as viable in windows explorer) in images if possible. 
						(Reflection on this idea has lead to the creation of a new image sorting system based fully around tagging rather than filepaths)

- Store MD5 fingerprint values of images in a file for each folder. Make matching images much quicker. 
						(This will likely be intergrated into the new tagging program then brought back into SortImg)

======================
Possible (Likely) Features
======================
- Text search on filenames of upcoming image queue. 
					(Would give a much greater amount of control over handling input images)
- Convert the hash compare to a background worker rather than loose threads
					(Needed incase the time taken is unreasnable)
- UI improvments
		- Make spliter between main view and tag panel obvious
		- Add mouse over info for buttons
		- Give ablity to completely hide the tag panel
		- Add a boarder to the preview panel
		- Quality of thumbnails should improve when the size of the preview panel is increaed.
		- Dynamicly calculate the load amount based off main window size and the size of the preview panel.
		- Change the tagging area to have tag area above the buttons and enter tage area, when draing panel up make the buttons constnace and grow the tag area.
		- Needs message if no matches are found on the MD5 folder sort
- Mutliselect.
		- Simply an filled array of selected images then sequenctly call the move, without refreshing the main image on each move, preview would just show last selected.
					(Fill on clicks (alt clicks like file exploreer? have shift click as well?, empty on another click, Try to enabel drag select)

======================
Bugs
======================

- Mouse over on the main image has issues.
- When adding a new folder for source the last dir should be used as a base point. This is relivent if the dialog is closed then loaded again.
- Spelling
- When clicking a image that is no existant it shows as a error image, it sould also update in the qeue and be removed. Rather it sould just remove, select the first item in queue (If items) and show a dialog saying selection has been removed or is bugged.
- Logging might have issues, needs to be tested more. (Suggest leaving off unless testing)
- Auto match checking on file moves might not work correctly even if enabled. (Suggest leaving off unless testing)
- Check that hotkeys are disabled when writing tags
