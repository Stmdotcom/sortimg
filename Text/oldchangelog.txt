2.0.0
=Added/Changed Features=
- Tab system gone
- New button to add source image directories. 
- Upcoming image display reworked
- Continuous use. there is no need to reset after a folder is sorted.
- Added in more advanced image matching (Can turn off in options, slower when on. Should match most resized images and very similar ones)
					- The more images sorted the slower the program will get due to the increased potential duplicates that need to be matched.
					- The program scales extremely well with computer speed and/or Win 7 use. 2 core WinXP to 4 core Win7 64bit speed increased vastly
- INI loading output
- Now uses auto image duplicate algorithms from derived from http://www.catpa.ws (Look for php image dup) Converted to C# with modifications.
- Various tools added to help users preform automated tasks.
	- Tool to filter images based on similarity
	- Tool to match images based on MD5 hashes calculated on grey-scale histograms (For debugging)
	- Tool to merger folders. Images are not moved if image in new folder has same name or size. if same name and different size it's file name is incremented.
- Visual feedback on keyboard interaction.
- New icons from http://www.eggheadcafe.com by NEADO Designs. These are free to use icons. I could not confirm old icons were free to use so all icons replaced.
- Can change destination folders by right click on move button.
- Add new tool: Convert BMP to new file format, lossless low compression PNG or High quality jpg. Note that C# has poor PNG conversions so the lossless compressions is not as good as 
a real image editor. For instance: 3.70MB bmp - 842KB jpg - 2.14MB png where as Photoshop will give 1.14MB for the same png.

=Technical=
- Hundreds of changes
- Massive amounts of code restructuring into separate classes

1.2.1 (Alpha)
=Added/Changed Features=
- Ability to change colour of folder names on "copy into" folders via right click (Cycles white and black) This is so you can still 
			see the name of the folder if the preview thumb is the same colour as the text
- Ability to click on main picture box to load gifs (Designed for animated gifs but currently allows any file with .gif extension).
- UI changes for better aesthetics
=Technical=
- Various code cleanups
- Added another thumbnail builder method. Order is.... exif thumb -> System thumbnail creator -> Custom thumbnail creator(added)
	This is added due to the system creator having issues with building thumbnails for larger images (Outofmemory exceptions)
			- Note that due to using exif thumb it might not always represent image if edited in a program like paint (Doesn't rebuild exif thumb from my tests)
- Thumbnail builder is now correctly used in all places thumbnails are used (Folder Preview added)

=Technical=
